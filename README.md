# Dissertation Template

I quickly created a template for the dissertation format requirement at USF.

# Work in progress

Tested and working on:
- **Overleaf**
- **Latexmk**

Miktex should work too. Someone told me that `\RequirePackage{color}` needed to be added but I'm not sure where. I blieve [here](https://github.com/jailby/dissertation_template/blob/master/Latex/usfmanus.cls#L8), so if you are using miktex and can confirm that pls send a PR :)

# Modifications

If the format requirement changes, or it does not compile for you and you want to submit a pull request (PR) please send a PR per change (like that I can review and accept quickly). KISS, Keep It Stupid Simple. Try tominimize the number of line changed.

Good luck :)

# Thanks

Thanks to Zach Beasley for the tip for Miktex
